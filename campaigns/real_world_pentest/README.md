# Real-World Penetration Testing Campaign

This directory contains a simulated real-world penetration testing campaign. The tools and scripts in this campaign are for authorized penetration testing purposes only.

## Campaign Lifecycle

The campaign is orchestrated by the `campaign_orchestrator.py` script and follows these phases:

1.  **Reconnaissance**: Gathers information about the target domain using the `tools/recon.py` script.
2.  **Initial Access**: Simulates a phishing attack to gain initial access to the target network using the `tools/initial_access.py` script.
3.  **Persistence**: Simulates establishing a reverse shell to a command and control (C2) server for persistent access using the `tools/persistence.py` script.
4.  **Exfiltration**: Simulates exfiltrating sensitive data from the target network using the `tools/exfiltration.py` script.

## Configuration

Before running the campaign, you need to configure the following in `campaign_orchestrator.py`:

*   `target_domain`: The domain of the authorized target.
*   `target_email`: The email address of an authorized target for the phishing simulation.
*   `c2_host`: The IP address of your C2 server.
*   `c2_port`: The port your C2 server is listening on.
*   `exfil_url`: The URL of your data exfiltration server.

## Running the Campaign

To run the campaign, execute the following command from the `real_world_pentest` directory:

```bash
python campaign_orchestrator.py
```

## Disclaimer

**This campaign is for authorized penetration testing purposes only. Do not use these tools against any system or network without explicit permission. Unauthorized use of these tools is illegal.**
